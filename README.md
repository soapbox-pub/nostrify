# NLib

Standards-compliant Nostr interfaces and modules in TypeScript.

NLib offers two things:

1. A types-only package for building your own Nostr tools in a standards-compliant way.
2. Suggested implementations of those interfaces, for use in your own projects.

## Why?

Existing Nostr libraries try to do either too much or too little. NLib aims to provide a middle ground, offering a set of interfaces that are both standards-compliant and flexible enough to be used in a variety of projects.

Interoperability should not be restricted just to the Nostr network. Code should be interoperable between projects, improving our ability to work together.

NLib embodies the spirit of the Nostr protocol AND web standards, so that things feel natural both to Nostr developers and to developers of JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Supported platforms

- Node.js (npm packages coming soon)
- Deno
- Browser

## Work in Progress

NLib is a work in progress. It is already being used in production projects, but the interfaces are not all finalized. However, it is being actively developed and contributions are welcome.
