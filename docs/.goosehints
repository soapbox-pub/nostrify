- The main sections include:
  - /start/ - Getting started guide
  - /relay/ - Relay connection management
  - /store/ - Storage implementations
  - /sign/ - Signing capabilities
  - /policy/ - Moderation policies
  - /schema/ - Nostr event schemas
  - /upload/ - File uploaders
  - /integrations/ - Third-party integrations

## Key Technologies
- VitePress - Vue-powered static site generator
- Markdown - Content format
- TypeScript - Language used in code examples
- JSR - Package registry for distributing Nostrify

## About Nostr
Nostr is a decentralized social network protocol. Nostrify is a framework that makes it easier to build applications using this protocol. Key concepts in Nostr include:
- Events - Data structures that are signed and shared between clients
- Relays - Servers that store and forward events
- Clients - Applications that users interact with
- Kinds - Different types of events (e.g., Kind 1 = text notes, Kind 0 = profiles)
- NIP - Nostr Implementation Possibilities (protocol standards)
